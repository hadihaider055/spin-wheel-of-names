# Contributing to Spin Wheel of Names

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Spin Wheel of Names as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](../../issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports.

## Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Make your changes
5. Test your changes thoroughly
6. Submit a pull request

## Coding Standards

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### Component Guidelines

- Create reusable components when possible
- Follow the existing component structure
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Include proper error handling
- Make components accessible (a11y)

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:

```
Add participant import/export functionality

- Allow CSV import of participant names
- Add export button for results
- Include validation for imported data
- Fixes #123
```

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please:

1. Check if the feature already exists
2. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
3. Provide detailed description of the feature
4. Explain why this feature would be useful
5. Consider submitting a pull request if you can implement it

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Test on different browsers and devices
- Verify accessibility compliance
- Test with different configurations

## Documentation

- Update README.md if needed
- Add inline code comments
- Update configuration examples
- Include usage examples for new features

## Community Guidelines

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Help others learn and grow
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Questions?

Don't hesitate to ask questions by opening an issue with the "question" label.
